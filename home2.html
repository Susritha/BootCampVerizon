  <h2>About Bharti Foundation</h2>
  "As a first step towards fulfilling the vision of the Government and the leadership of the country, Bharti has kick-started its voluntary and affirmative action in making significant contribution to provide education to the weaker sections of the society, so as to make them employable. We need to ensure that our children and young people have access to quality education. Through Bharti Foundation we are determined to make a substantial impact in this area."<br>

Quality education is the most powerful tool for socio-economic transformation of a country. It not only eradicates poverty but also ensures equity among people. Therefore, ensuring access to quality education for all, in particular for underprivileged children from disadvantaged and marginalized communities, is of immense significance for overall development of India.

It was to partake in this journey towards quality education that Bharti Foundation, the philanthropic wing of Bharti Group of Companies, was set up in 2000. The Foundation implements and supports quality education programs across primary, elementary, senior secondary and higher education levels.

All educational programs initiated by Bharti Foundation entail close partnerships with the government, policy makers, corporations, local communities and the general public. These programs aim at holistic development of children making them employable citizens with a deep sense of commitment to society. The intent is to develop a scalable and sustainable education model that can be replicated on a large scale by the government, educational institutions and like-minded organizations.</p>
